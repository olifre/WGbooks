<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The last rays of the sun had long been gone when he exited the house he lived in; his eyes
searched the sky, and soon they found the singular star he loved, and his heart
rejoiced. This was the moment of each day that was to himself, and he appreciated
it.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  A big bird crossed the sky, her tail just touching the little star, and he knew that everything
was alright — as far as that is possible.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  ‘Simetra, come here,’ he said in a low voice that could only be heard by that gigantic bird.
It was the only creature that would never betray him, and the partnership that connected
the two unequal beings wouldn’t end until one of them died. All these thoughts
in his mind, he raised one arm for the bird to sit on; then, his eyes searched the
moon, and it was still there, hanging high above in the sky, and shining brightly on
the grey, majestic feathers of the bird that had safely found the right place on his
arm.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  The bird followed his friend’s eyes and stared at the moon, and suddenly, she rised up again
and started to fly towards it; the wonderful picture of the big creature in front of
the moon gave the impression of clarity, stability and the wonderful dream of a
fairytale.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  This was the Night of Existence. The night when he had been born, and the same night
when his parents had bought this bird; and the very same night when they both had
died.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  Slowly, tears ran down his cheeks, but he didn’t try to stop them. Simetra knew better than
return to him now and explored the sky once more, as she felt she’d better leave him alone for
some minutes. Twenty years had gone by since that day, and now, the two of them were the
last survivors.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  The next minutes would pass in silence. Then, Simetra would return, crossing the sky in the
front of his eyes, giving him the power to hope once more, and the energy to stay
alive.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  With a movement of his left hand, he made the tears go away; but the pain would
stay, though it would now subside for some time. He took a deep breath, and his
arm was shaking when he rised it once more; his broken voice called his last friend
for another time, and she came. Finally, when she had sat down once more, their
eyes met. Simetra felt the strong emotions and the powerful soul that was there
inside him, and he felt the power of the bird; they would never leave each other
alone.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  Two minutes had gone by when Simetra rised once more, and he took a walk around,
thinking of the years that had passed. They had been happy, as happy as they could have been
when you had to live on your own amongst alien people; he didn’t have any friends,
and only some of those strange beings around him had taken care of him. They
seemed to fear that bird, the single creature that was — and had always been — his
friend.
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  The only creature that had saved him that night, and the only living being that knew what
had happened. There must have been an attack, and the young Simetra had been found sitting
on top of him who was hidden beneath a piece of cloth. Thus, the bird had saved his life,
                                                                                
                                                                                
endangering her own.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  His eyes followed the wonderful lines his only friend painted at the sky; then, he realized
that this night was not only a night of the past. The strange people that had taken care of him
had only promised to do so for twenty years.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  This time had passed right now. He wondered whether this would be a chance or the
moment which would lead to his death; His companion would protect him, but she couldn’t do
a thing against fate.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  Nobody could. And nobody could know about his or her destiny in advance. If he was
doomed to die, he would; if he wasn’t, he wouldn’t, and no power could change that. Fate
could decide whether somebody was invincible. It had decided his parents weren’t. Nobody
could go back and change that.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  Tomorrow, he’d have to leave this part of the country, and he’d do so with more sorrow than
happiness, as even though these people hadn’t liked the boy who had attracted so much
aggression he had grown familiar with them and this land. He decided to take a last glance at
those houses around here; the next day, they would provide him with some food
and send him away. He’d already organized a horse to be able to reach another
city.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  Another city — he’d never been anywhere else, and all around this place there was deep
wood. This meant that he’d not be able to ride on his horse, but he’d figured out that this
wood must end somewhere. However, nobody in this city had ever left it and came back to tell
the others about it; the only pieces of information he could get were the ancient
books of those who had travelled out there, and the things he’d learned by watching
Simetra, who seemed to be awaiting that day eagerly, as she felt the growing tension of
his.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >  The cold of the night was becoming apparent to the bird, and she felt that it must make
his friend shiver, but he noticed nothing of it, as the real cold was inside. When
Simetra sat down next to him for another time, he felt the warmth of hope once more,
and suddenly realized how cold it was. After some seconds of contemplation, he
decided that the two of them should go home to sleep, as they’d have to leave early
tomorrow.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  However, he knew he couldn’t sleep, and it was not until Simetra had reassured him by
sitting close to his bed that he closed his eyes, sleeping the exhausting sleep of an orphan of
fate. Soon, Simetra would also close one of her eyes and join in to a half-sleep; however, she
would always be alert if any danger would arrive.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >  But this night, the only danger were the nightmare-like memories that chased him through
his dreams, and Simetra could do nothing about it, though she longed to chase away any
danger out there.
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
<!--l. 1--><p class="indent" >
                                                                                
                                                                                
  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">2</span>  <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Voyage in Solitude</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The first rays of the sun had just touched his still closed eyes when one of the villagers was on
his way to the house he resided in, bringing some food, the last gift he would be given by these
people. Simetra noticed the person, but she knew that she’d better keep silent until he was
gone; A tamed animal was something unnatural to them, and an animal that took care of a
human being and showed emotions was something that could only be achieved by using evil
powers.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  Thus, the villager seemed afraid when opening the door carefully, but when there was
nobody to be seen downstairs, he sighed, entered quickly and silent, dropped the food on the
table and was gone even more quickly than he’d arrived. The food was the last sign he’d left,
and it would also be the last significant symbol of that village for the two friends. No letter, no
word was left, and one may wonder whether the villagers gave a party because the two demons
were gone; We won’t ever know, as we’ll accompany those two fellows without returning to
that place which we won’t ever see again the way it is now, with it’s high-climbing trees and
the small huts, the fire and the belief in evil spirits; all those details will be lost for us,
and among these the superstitous villagers, which couldn’t do a thing against their
belief.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Right now, Simetra touched his nose carefully, and he woke up slowly, as he felt the presence
of his friend and the feeling of safety and peace the bird brought with her. No danger would
come near him right now, but he knew he had to leave. All his bags had been packed days ago,
and it would have taken him no more that ten minutes to get ready; but he had to take a look
around once more, keeping these pictures of the beloved house in mind. He felt that
none of the villagers would ever dare to touch it or live in it, and he realized that it
was another friend of his who would wait for his return if he ever decided to come
back.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Half an hour later, he’d walked through most of the now empty rooms, remembering all the
tiny little memories that were connected to them; Now, he stood in front of the room he’d
never opened again. The room where his parents had died. He knew he had to open this door
today, as he could probably find some signs that would explain what had happened and who
was responsible for it.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  But for a quarter of an hour, he just stood there, staring at the door and the old, rusty
handle which had not been used for twenty years. Furthermore, all windows had been shut
tightly, as the villagers had feared the dead spirits to hunt them at night; thus, he had never
taken a look inside this room, and even the keyhole was shut tightly. He had received a key
with the food, a key to that room, as the villagers knew he wouldn’t leave without having
taken a look inside it.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Slowly, he took the key and put it into the keyhole. It fit. A minute later, he was turning it,
and the old lock still worked with a ‘click’. Now, he could not go back anymore. It took
seconds until his right hand touched the cold, rough handle. Slowly, he pushed it down, and
the door showed only weak resistance.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  For the first time since tweny years, rays of sunlight touched the floor of the room which
had been the place where a brutal crime had taken place. Two brutal crimes, to be exactly.
The only thing the villagers had ever done was to take the corpses away to bury them
somewhere in the deep woods, far away from their houses; then, they had sealed the room
                                                                                
                                                                                
tight. The first thing he saw was the blood, the blood of his own parents on the floor. Of
course, it was just a stain of blood, as bacteria and other creatures had cleaned most of it
away; but time could never eradicate the horrible strength of the symbolic link between this
blood and him.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  He sighed, then he took one step into the room, closing the door behind him. Simetra had to
stay outside; this would be a voyage into his past, and it would be a voyage in solitude. Up to
now, he had not noticed that there was still light in this room; he searched for the source and
found a golden medal, just lying next to one of the red stains. It was sending out a warm,
yellow light, and he couldn’t remember having seen this light before he’d opened the
room through the cracks of the door; it must have started to emanate this light
just at the moment when he’d opened the door. Still, he felt very nervous when he
realized that he had not wondered why there was light in here when he’d opened the
door.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  He decided to think about this later, and he picked up the medal. The same moment his
fingers touched the (warm?) metal, a surprisingly strong feeling took hold of him; This was
something he’d never experienced before. He <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">remembered </span>something he’d never seen, and he
couldn’t help but watch what was going on without interfering into this magical
process.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  Light flooded through the room, but not the cold, white light of a bulb, but the
warm rays of the sun; the windows that had been shut tightly were open, and it was
summer. The buzz of all those insects in the woods became present as he realized he
wasn’t alone. A woman was standing in front of him, and he didn’t waste any time
trying to find out who she was; he <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">knew </span>his mother though he’d only seen her as a
baby. The vibrating, emotional connection that linked the two beings made their
eyes glow; but both of them knew this wasn’t real. The urge to step forward and
embrace her became his dearest wish, but he couldn’t do so, as this was a holography.
He wondered where this word had suddenly come from, but he understood that it
was simply there, and he understood without any explanation. Then, his mother
started talking, destroying the painful and yet wonderful silence that could not
yet last forever. ‘I can see in your eyes that you know who I am, and that you’ve
realized that I am dead,’ was the way she started. He was startled, but he didn’t
flinch, as he heard the voice of the creature that gave birth to him. ‘You must listen
carefully now; please don’t ask any questions, I cannot answer them. What has
happened, is done, and cannot be changed neither now nor in the future, even if it
was completely wrong. On the other hand, this is probably the only way to make
our vision of the future come true. You must know that powers are working, evil
powers of unknown strength; I imagine you must look quite self-confident now, but
know you cannot face up to them. There is one person who can; this girl is your
sister.’
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  A sister? Now, he indeed began to tremble. He had a family, even if it was only small; but
he was not alone, though he’d never really been. Simetra was still there, and she would
accompany him for the rest of his life. ‘I feel you must be astonished now. I would give
anything to be able to take a look at your face, but it is impossible for me to come back. My
life wasn’t taken for nothing; you have survived, and your sister is well-hidden. She
                                                                                
                                                                                
doesn’t even know what she is supposed to do, nor has she realized who she is. It
is your task, my son, to find her and to give her all the protection you can offer.
Don’t ask me where you should start to search for her; I cannot tell you, for anyone
could find this record and listen to it. Trust yourself; your heart will guide you, and
your companion will help you to accomplish your task. I must leave now; I can hear
they are coming, and you shall not see how your own parents are killed. We will
meet again, please know that; but don’t look forward to it, times will have changed
then.’
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  Loud footsteps could be heard, and as quickly as the vision had appeared, the room was
empty again; and this time, it was completely dark. He knew he’d seen everything; there
was nothing more to do. The medal hanging around his neck as if it was a normal
necklace, he exited the room. After he’d closed the door, he breathed again, suddenly
realizing he hadn’t done so for a minute. Still, his eyes were fixed and he could hear
the words of his mother; He checked the medal, but it was cold now. It would not
be opened yet; he had to think about everything, and Simetra would be with him
then.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  The weight of a feather dropped on his shoulder, and he didn’t need to turn his head to
know she was there. Nothing had to be said right now; He took the things he’d packed long
ago, and left the village, not looking back once more. The time of being subdued was gone.
Now, he had a task, and he was to do something important: He had to find his sister, the only
relative that was left now.
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">3</span>  <a 
 id="x1-40003"></a>First Steps</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >A light breeze cooled his neck when Simetra dropped on his shoulder again. There was nothing
she could report; After they had passed the ancient gate that guarded the village, everything
had become silent. No single animal seemed to be alive round here, and the trees to
each side had grown so high that the sky was not to be seen. Simetra had been up
there several times, and she had just returned, but there was nothing she could
do. The end of the forest could not be made out, and even for her, this was a new
sight, for she had never been so far away from the village that she couldn’t see it
anymore.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >  The path he was treading upon was completely covered up with branches and leaves so he
could hardly go on, but he was decided to do so. At least three hours must have passed by
now, but the surroundings hadn’t changed since the time they started, while his mind told him
that the scenery was even darker and more dangerous. Simetra was unnaturally nervous, and
the silence that was only interrupted by breaking branches below his feet seemed to
hamper his breathing, for it was a weight much heavier than his backpack could ever
be.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  Simetra rose again, and broke through the roof the trees had constructed once more. For
him, the silence became a load even heavier.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  Five minutes or so, he began wondering where Simetra had gone, but he knew she would
return; Probably, she was flying further away to find out about a way out of this graveyard of
nature. Realizing that walking on wouldn’t help for he didn’t see the path anymore, as it was
now covered up completely, he sat down and ate a bread and an apple. Then, he noticed what
was so special about this forest: There was no water, and the bottle he had with him would
only last for a few days. This forest must have been dead for ages, and one could wonder how
it could still be there, for it seemed so thick as if it was still growing — but it wasn’t
alive.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  It was deserted, in the literal meaning.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  And water seemed as rare as it was in a desert. He’d read about deserts, in the ancient
books, but they were full of sand, and this one was full of trees — However, the description
seemed to fit perfectly. A cry of a bird disturbed his thoughts — Simetra returned. He
answered with an equal cry, and she knew where to find him. After she had crashed through
the rooftop, he offered her some bread, but she nervously moved her beak, pointing behind
him. There was nothing he could see, but he realized that somebody — or something — must
be coming. Simetra had warned him. Quickly, he hid behind a big, black tree, after he’d stored
the food in his backpack again. Simetra sat on his shoulder, and the two of them stood there,
behind the tree, watching the dead place in a million of dead places, waiting for it to reveal
one of its secrets.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  He watched to the left, for this was the direction Simetra had pointed out — the leaves
began to move.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  Everything was silent, and not even a breeze could be felt, but nevertheless, the leaves
moved.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  And some trees seemed to fall down. <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">Silently.</span>
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  This movement originated from something he couldn’t make out clearly yet — but it was
coming closer. He decided to take a step back and choose another tree, now climbing
                                                                                
                                                                                
on a branch so he could not be seen from below. And he was right to do so, for
something gigantic was coming. Gigantic in matters of effect, not concerning the real
size.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >  The movement came closer, and some trees nearby fell down to reveal the sight on a small,
black, quickly moving figure that threw trees around and cleared a kind of path. Still, there
was absolute silence, and he knew that if Simetra hadn’t warned him, he would
probably have been killed by that small figure down there, for it seemed to lack
eyes and was simply going straightforward, destroying the forest in front of him,
her, it or whatever it was. As quickly as the figure had appeared, it was gone, and
he wanted to climb down to have a look at this new road, but Simetra stopped
him.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  He knew she wouldn’t do so if this wasn’t necessary, and thus, he decided to wait. This was
a peculiar and dangerous forest, and for he hadn’t seen such areas of destruction before, he
wondered whether he simply had not come along such a small figure or whether something else
would happen. He’d soon find out.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  After this ’roadbuilder’ had gone, a ghastly noise shook the earth. The silence that
had been there before was now replaced by a noise he could hardly endure, and it
felt as if thousands of termites were eating on a piece of wood. And this was quite
close to what really happened: Blue figures of equal size arrived, eating the trees
that had fallen down in a monstrous speed. They left behind a black, somehow
moving liquid, that smelled as if…No, he couldn’t compare this nasty smell to anything
he’d ever smelled before. He was glad to see those figures go away, for this meant
that he could take his fingers out of his ears again, for the noise must become less
brutal.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  But another, equally nasty noise would still be there, and the stinking mass was still
moving. This liquid was the thing that made the noises, and soon, he saw why: Little
trees began to grow in the middle of this mass, and he couldn’t help but watch for
some minutes until the area of destruction was filled up with trees and branches
again.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  The black mass was gone, accompanied by the fouly smell and the loud noise. Now, he
climbed down, and Simetra didn’t stop him. No borders could be made out — The new patch
of forest fit in perfectly. He wondered in which way this destruction and reconstruction was
effective, but of course, this was the explanation why the dead forest was still alive: Those
creatures rebuilt it steadily. And though he knew they were dangerous, he was happy that
they were there, for it meant he wasn’t the only living being here — with Simetra, of
course.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  And Simetra would now happily point out another direction to him, and he knew that he
should advance in that one, for she seemed happy, as if there was a patch of green far, far
away…
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
<!--l. 1--><p class="indent" >
                                                                                
                                                                                
  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">4</span>  <a 
 id="x1-50004"></a>The First Arrival</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Crack.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  This was the only noise he’d heard for hours: The cracking of dead twigs beneath his shoes.
And it was only for Simetra he went on walking, for something had took hold of her, a kind of
nervous happiness. He had spent the time thinking: The black figure that had destroyed the
wood only for it to be built up again; How could such a system have developed? And
why?
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >  It was a kind of steady state, based on steady change — it was <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">life</span>. The ups and downs of
life had found their symbolic expression right here: Though the woods seemed dead, they
were alive — half-alive, at least. And the processes of destruction and construction
fit so perfectly as if they were made to be presented to somebody else to watch
them.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  However, it was all a system of steady-state, in the end. It didn’t make any sense,
destroying and rebuilding constantly. He’d sometimes seen the inhabitants of ’his’
village fight each other, crushing their houses, only to rebuilt them shortly after —
this had been senseless, too, and he couldn’t understand the motivation for those
fights.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  Nevertheless, this left him to realize one thing: There was a lack of sense in life. There
certainly was. But still, he felt that there had to be some motivation he couldn’t understand in
those actions.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  A sudden burst of sunlight, the first since hours, and a shriek of Simetra told him that he
was close to a clearing; he didn’t know what was waiting for him, but he had to be very
cautious, of course — these peculiar black and blue figures could have killed him, if it wasn’t
for Simetra’s warning.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  He was staring concentratedly towards the area where less trees were trying to suffocate
everything else — the clearing seemed to be about one hundred metres in front of him. Slowly,
and prepared to face nearly everything, he advanced, trying to make no sound though this was
pretty hard to achieve with all those dry, dead twigs beneath your shoes. And the silence
around him seemed absolute. Soon, he had reached the place where the clearing had to begin;
He could hide behind two trees and overlook the area, where no dead forest was growing. And
it was green.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  So green, in fact, that he was blind for some seconds until he had readapted to seeing a
patch of nature so vivid. But this place was small, and he realized that it had probably just
been left out by chance, as the black figure that destroyed the forest seemed to
advance quite randomly. However, there it was. And he took a further look at it;
But it still took him some time to notice the most special thing he’d ever seen:
It (sat? stood?) in the middle of the clearing, on some big stones that had been
arranged in a way that pleased your eyes, as if somebody had really done so on
purpose.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  And that — creature — was as green as the grass around those stones, and it still took him
some time to make her out clearly, for she was a female — a fairy. He could remember the
things he’d read about fairies: Once upon a time, they must’ve been all around, and the book
only said that they brought happiness to the people.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  In some inexplicable way he was attracted by her — she was sleeping, and her head was
                                                                                
                                                                                
lying on one of these stones, her hands put underneath to protect the bright, shining skin from
the rough surface. She was emanating light, and her hair seemed to glow in a yellow colour,
and now, he could even make out a glimpse of her shiny, translucent wings that were folded on
her back. She was pretty, if you can say that about a fairy, and he still stood there,
wondering how she might have come into this dead forest. It must have been her magic
that had conserved this patch of green, or some other magic that had conserved
both.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  His hand moved to shove away another twig so he could see her better, and the light green
of her dress began to move as she became awake. Quickly, the thin body moved and particles
of white, glowing dust were emitted from her as her bare feet touched the ground. Looking
around nervously, the small fairy couldn’t make him out immediately. He decided to take
another step, and the green fairy shrieked before she rose into the air displaying an abnormous
speed. Simetra sat off quickly to follow her, but she was far too slow to do so and
soon had to return to him for the fairy was gone, leaving behind only a trace of
that white, glowing dust that dropped on him, giving this boy a warm feeling as it
touched his skin and stopped glowing. He had quickly run to the stone in the middle
of the clearing, but he could not see her anymore. He was amazed, and puzzled
for a minute. Fairies had been inventions of that old books — they had been part
of stories that had been written for entertainment. They could certainly not be
real? Well, they were as real as that black and blue figures that ‘worked’ on the
wood.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  Astonished, he felt over the stone that seemed to be still warm — it was smooth, and more
of that dust was lying on these rocks. He sat down, and felt quite comfortable, for the stone
that was supposed to be hard wasn’t. A splashing sound woke him up immediately: A small
fountain had emerged from the middle of the stones, and it looked as if it had been there
forever, but he was sure it had just developed. The water was very clear, and it seemed to
shine with a light that resembled the light of that dust — then, he realized that the dust that
was lying on the stones was still shiny, while the particles that had touched his skin
weren’t.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  He recalled the prickling sensation he’d felt when they had dropped on him, and he realized
that they must be important. Taking out a pouch of leather, he collected them, using a piece
of cloth so as not to touch the glowing particles. Even if there was no magic about them, they
would serve as a light in the dark. Simetra came down again and dropped on one of the
stones, suspiciously analyzing the water and sneezing as she’d breezed in some of the
dust. He’d just closed the pouch as he was shocked by a noise that must be part of
his imagination, but wasn’t. A — familiar — voice said: ‘You may drink, it’s not
poisonous.’
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  Simetra was talking. If he wasn’t subject to a sudden and inexplicable illness, this dust must
be full of magic, indeed. And he decided to do what Simetra had told him, and he gladly
swallowed the fresh water — it was sweet and vivid, remembering him of the fairy that had
made this spring come alive. The flask he had with him was filled quickly, and after Simetra
had drunk, the spring went dry.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  All of a sudden, the tiny rests of the dust vanished, and the stones seemed to begin to move.
The clearing seemed to go away. Simetra rose high with a shriek and came down again quickly,
                                                                                
                                                                                
but he was already standing in the middle of the dead forest again that had filled up the space
the green grass had filled before immediately.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >  Simetra told him that the clearing was indeed — moving away, shrinking against
the horizon. He was still afraid to hear her talking, but he was getting used to it,
as he had always imagined her talking to him — only that she really <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">did </span>so now.
Irritating.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >  But she was right — as she told him the direction in that the clearing was moving, he knew
he had to follow her. It was the only place he’d ever seen since he’d left the village which
wasn’t dead, and which was full of fascinating magic. He had to see it again. He had to see her
again.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >  And he had to find out what was going on here, even if it took him hours to reach
the clearing again. Or days. What else could he do? There was no water around,
and he’d need more; And the only place where he knew water was to be found was
the clearing. He took a step, and another one, absorbed in his thoughts and barely
noticing Simetra, who was sitting on his shoulder quietly now. He was striving to
<span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">arrive</span>.
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">5</span>  <a 
 id="x1-60005"></a>Crossing the Great Water</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Silence.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  Still, Simetra was with him, and from time to time, she beat her wings and rose up high in
the air to try to make out anything that was different from that monotonous forest. And each
time, she had returned telling him that nothing was changing, but that things looked
the same in every direction. Finally, she just shook her head imitating the gesture
humans used to tell someone else that something was wrong or not working out
correctly.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  Indeed, she had adopted some human traits when that pieces of dust had touched her, and
she seemed to have become an even more important part of his life. But slowly, both of them
felt that a wind was rising: First, it seemed as if the wood was breathing, but then, they could
make out a direction, and they were advancing exactly that way. Though the leaves were
moving now, silence was still all around.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >  He decided to go more quickly, and an hour or so later, Simetra told him that there was a
sea in that direction. A grey, nearly black, dead liquid filled this sea, and Simetra
added that she could not make out the end of it for it stretched to the horizon — at
least.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  He decided to take a rest right here, for it would probably take him another hour or so to
reach this new obstacle. At least, something was happening — the monotonous forest
would end somewhere. But where had the clearing gone? Had it crossed the sea? Or
had the fairy simply taken the magic away, and tried to escape by flying over that
ocean? He’d never seen an ocean. He just knew that it was a big, gigantic amount of
water a human being could not cross so easily. In fact, he’d only read that this
was possible, but he’d never found out about a way to do it. And probably, this
ocean wasn’t even filled with water, but he doubted one could walk on such a grey
liquid, and Simetra told him that storms and strong winds were triggering off high
waves that made it even hard for her to fly over it, for the wind would become even
stronger.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  But he simply had to do it. He had to find out what was happening here. For now, he sat
down and unpacked another piece of bread. When he wanted to get his flask out of his
backpack, the leather pouch that contained the dust fell on the ground. Simetra told him for
he hadn’t noticed; but some particles of this strange, magic dust had already escaped the
pouch and touched the dead earth.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  And a small, green plant began to grow. He quickly grabbed the pouch so he would not lose
any more of this magic memory; And then, the first nuts on the plant eagerly awaited the
moment they would be taken off. He took one of them, and as soon as his fingers touched it, a
voice in his mind told him:
     <blockquote class="quote">
     <!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Use the dust of fairies wisely —<br 
class="newline" />it can safe your life, and help you to continue your voyage.</blockquote>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >He dropped this nut in his lap, and touched another one; another voice emerged from
nowhere:
                                                                                
                                                                                
     <blockquote class="quote">
     <!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Don’t ask for more —<br 
class="newline" />this is all that is to be said for now.</blockquote>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >He laid this nut to the other one in his lap, and those two became darker — the others seemed to
be still green, and glowed a bit, but this could just be an invention of his mind for everything
else around here seemed to be without colour.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  However, he decided to touch the other nuts with a piece of cloth before he put them in his
bag, for he wanted to take these nutritious counselours with him without using up their
energy. It seemed to work, for their glow remained and they stayed green. The two he’d taken
off — He felt they had to be cracked, for he’d need to find out whether they were really edible.
He took the two stones that were lying below the tree (<span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">he couldn’t recall having seen them</span>
<span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">before</span>) and cracked the first one carefully. The shell could be opened quite easily, and the
small and light stones found their place in his backpack together with the other, already ‘used’
nut.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  Simetra hopped on his leg and analysed the ingredients of the just cracked nut with her
beak; Finally, she tasted a small piece pf it and seemed satisfied. Though she could speak, he
didn’t need to listen to her saying that everything was fine (though she said so); And he tasted
it. The small and tiny bit of this nut suddenly seemed to grow in his mouth and filled it
completely, but leaving enough room to chew comfortably. It was a wonderful, refreshing taste
and he didn’t become thirsty — in fact, his thirst vanished, accompanied by his
hunger.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  He was satisfied, and so was Simetra. The rest of the nut found their place in another small
pouch, but he wouldn’t need these in the next hours. Now, he had to make his way to the sea,
and he felt strong enough to face everything that would come. Soon, the wind became stronger
and very cold, but he was indifferent to that change, and so was Simetra: The ingredients of
the nut seemed to protect them against some of those obstacles. Half an hour later, he reached
the ocean. And it really was the way Simetra had described: A grey, dead mass of liquid,
smelling a bit like the black mass that had been the strange dung that had made this
dead wood grow. He took a branch from the ground and touched the water with it,
and as he drew it back, the part of the branch that had touched the liquid was
gone.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >  It seemed to have been cut off perfectly — as if the water had done so. Certainly, this was
no water, or at least, not only water, and it wasn’t only dead, but could kill. He remembered
what the nut had ’said’: The dust could save his life, and it could help him to go on. But did
this mean that he was protected against the effects of that liquid? He doubted this to be true,
but he had to find out. His fingernails were quite long, as he’d never had to think about
anybody showing interest in him in that village he’d come from — and sometimes, long
fingernails were useful. One of that ’sometimes’ was now. He was lucky that the waves
didn’t come as close as he’d expected, because they seemed to stop just one metre
before they’d reach the forest, as if there was some secret contract of fear between
those two landscapes. Thus, he could give it a try. Slowly, his finger approached the
surface, and as soon as his nail touched the liquid, a shot of pain raced through his
                                                                                
                                                                                
finger, his hand, his body. In a reaction of reflex, he drew his hand back and fell
on the ground behind him. Some twigs cracked, and he quickly had a look at his
finger: Nothing seemed to be wrong, though. Even the nail wasn’t hurt; but he could
still recall this killing pain, and he knew that this was the wrong way to cross the
ocean.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >  He stood up and took a step back, sat down again and open his bag another
time. Now, he took his time to count the nuts: There were 11 of them left. But he
had to take one of them now. He waited for another moment: The ‘dust of fairies’
would save him. Yes! This was the solution. Not the nut alone could help him to
cross that sea, but the dust itself must be used. But he didn’t know where to apply
it…
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  Simetra rose in the air, and tried to make her way against that storm. The power the nut
had given her seemed to help, for she seemed to be able to advance. Quickly, she returned to
the ground to tell him about her success…When he saw Simetra coming down, he realized he’d
found the solution. He’d have to fly! And when she touched the ground next to him and said
that she could probably make it now over the ocean, he took a piece of cloth and carefully
grabbed some parrticles of that wonderful particles. He realized he’d have to take his shirt off.
Simetra was watching curiously as he put the dust back into the pouch and dropped his shirt
after having taken it off; then, he took the piece of cloth again, grabbed some particles of
the dust and carefully dropped them on his back, being reminded of the fairy. It
worked.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  Simetra shrieked, as two translucent wings were growing on his back. A warm feeling went
through him, and he closed the pouch carefully so as not to lose one of these particles. He
closed his back again; he knew he’d found the right solution, and Simetra knew what he was
up to before even one word had been spoken.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >  Before he could wonder how those wings were working, they unfolded themselves and he
rose high in the air; and there was another voice, that asked him where he wanted to go, but
his mind was still filled by that image of the clearing, as it had been since he’d lost it —
and her. Thus, he shot forward, and Simetra could barely follow him. The wind
around him and the feeling of that killing sea below was thrilling him — and he
imagined that Simetra must feel like this all the time. He wondered how long the
journey would take, but he enjoyed it; slowly, the sight of the wood behind was
disappearing, and he wondered where they were going, if they were really going
somewhere…
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >  An hour later, there was nothing but that water all below, and it went up to the horizon.
The wind was gone, however, and he imagined what would happen if this sea was infinite,
and if he was to fly like this for the rest of his life. Simetra had already found a
place on his shoulder some time before, as she was tired to fly at such a speed. No
clouds were to be seen, and nothing seemed to be alive around here except the two of
them.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly, the idea of a piece of land appeared in front of them; first, it just looked like an
island, then, it grew steadily until he could see — that it was a landscape full of dead,
grey trees. Had they finally just flew in a circle? Simetra knew what he must be
thinking, and she told him they weren’t; they had not changed the direction at any
                                                                                
                                                                                
time, and she knew that for sure. She was a bird, and her orientation could not be
doubted, but nevertheless, the landscape looked so similar that this was hard to
imagine.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >  Simetra left his shoulder again, and he slowly began to descend; when he was close to the
top of the trees, he thought he could make out a patch of green some hundred metres away,
but he wasn’t sure, for he simply crashed through the treetops. The last thing he heard was a
big and loud ‘Thump!’ when his body was smashed against one of the trees, and then
everything went dark.

  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">6</span>  <a 
 id="x1-70006"></a>Cold and Starry</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >A light breeze was running through countless leafs over a forest that was full of silence.
Everything was grey in the cold and starry night, and the sun had long been gone, only to be
replaced by a full moon whose light didn’t enlighten anything except a small patch of
green. Slowly, the grass began to move as the wind went through it, and a tiny figure
that had been lying on the stones in the middle of that clearing began to rise. The
creature shook his head and searched for his backpack, which was leaning against
one of the stones nearby. A peculiar, magic light was around him which emanated
from the dust that was floating in the air, but nothing alive was to be seen around
him.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  He was alone, and for the first time in his life he didn’t know where Simetra had gone and
whether she would ever return to him.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  He began to move towards the forest that enclosed the perfectly round clearing; What had
happened in the last hours? A terrible headache was the misty cloud that covered his
memories, and he could only wander around and wait for that memory to return to him.
Suddenly, he stopped dead. Wasn’t that a sound, as if majestic wings had moved the air
nearby? He looked around, and then high into the sky, and finally, he shrieked to call Simetra;
but there was no reaction. The wood was dead, and the air above seemed to be the
same.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  He wondered how long he had slept; Now, he was very hungry. As there was nothing he
could do but worry, he sat down and opened his backpack, searching for something to eat. But
before he could do so, he saw the nuts, and everything came back to him in a second. He had
seen the fairy in the clearing; The nuts had grown, and finally, he had flown over
the sea. The wings; his hands searched for them, but they were gone, and he was
wearing his shirt again. The crash — there had been a crash. The sound of the
crushing trees and his smashed bones was as vivid as if it had just happened, and
reverberated in his whole body. He must be dead, nobody could survive such a
crash.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  Somebody must have taken care of him. No, this couldn’t be; The fairy would certainly not
have healed him? But Simetra could not have done, that was for sure. Where had she gone?
He imitated her shriek again, and the sound echoed through his mind, but everything else was
silent.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  As deadly silent as it had ever been. But he had reached the clearing, he was still there; The
shiny nuts were still in his backpack, and they seemed to ask for his questions. He
took a look around — this certainly <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">was </span>a hopeless situation, and he would need
some help. He counted the nuts once more, finding 11 of them — they were all
there. When his hand touched one of the nuts, a question was rising in his mind, but
it wasn’t the correct one; He was asking why the fairy had helped him, and that
was not of any real importance right now. But it was too late, and the nut told
him:
     <blockquote class="quote">
     <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Search your memory, the answer is there<br 
class="newline" />asking things you know for long is not fair.</blockquote>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >He was close to tears. Not only had he lost one nut, but he was also responsible for this loss, and
he had even been punished for it by the nut’s words. Of course, the dust that was
around him was a kind of magic shield the fairy had set up as she had been here;
Nobody could come near, at least not if he or her was no real magician. This was
what he had read, at least. And he had just played with the magic the fairy had
left…
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  He felt as if he was a stupid little boy, and his stomach told him he was when it grunted
loudly because he was still very hungry. He could use some bits of the nut, at least, though
there was still most of the last nut left.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  Seconds later, he felt refreshed and wasn’t hungry anymore. The rests of this new nut had
wandered to those of the old one, and he knew that they wouldn’t ever lose a bit of their
refreshing powers. This time, he concentrated. What did he need to know? And once
more, he was caught in a conflict: Should he ask for the place where he could find
Simetra, his oldest friend, the place where the fairy had gone, or the way he should
proceed? He wondered whether Simetra had followed the fairy. But he wasn’t sure what
he’d be told if he simply asked for the place they had gone to. Well, he was also
wondering what he’d be told if he asked how he should proceed, but what else could
he ask? And wasn’t all that questioning about wondering what the answer would
be?
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >  He took another walk around the stones. He’d need an answer. The third option was the
correct one. Yes, of course: The right way to proceed must be the way to find the fairy <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">and</span>
Simetra, and thus, he could answer all those questions if he just decided to ask this one. He
breathed in once more and felt the refreshing effect of the magic air around him; But he
couldn’t help but see the image of the fairy lying on the stone again, and he knew he
would have to concentrate very hard. He sat down on the magically warmed stone
and focussed his mind on the question how he should proceed. It seemed to work;
now, he’d have to take the nut without remembering the way he’d come to own it.
He opened his backpack, and his hand reached inside, carefully selecting another
nut.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  It seemed to work; the voice raised in his mind again, and it said:
     <blockquote class="quote">
     <!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >You ask how to proceed,<br 
class="newline" />and to be told what to do.<br 
class="newline" />Do not search for an answer,<br 
class="newline" />it is inside;<br 
class="newline" />your mind has told you whom to follow,<br 
class="newline" />just look inside: These nuts are hollow.</blockquote>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >For a second, he stayed in this stunned state of concentration; Then, he began to wonder what
this was supposed to mean. He took the two small stones and cracked the nut carefully,
looking at the contents. Nothing seemed different with this nut. But then, he had a look at the
                                                                                
                                                                                
inside of shell that had enclosed these nutritious ingredients: This was no normal nut. Of
course, he had know this before, but now, he could make out a sign inside the shell: An arrow.
The other half displayed the same sign, and soon, he was analyzing the other nuts: He found
the symbol of two wings and of a clearing with a kind of shield around it. Well,
exactly the things he’d figured out earlier…But what was the arrow supposed to
mean?
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >  One of the two pieces of the nut he was holding currently fell to the ground. When he
wanted to pick it up again, he realized that it was <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">moving</span>. It was turning into a specific
direction. He laid the other piece next to this one, and it reacted the same way,
pointing into the very same direction. But in which way had his mind told him whom
to follow? Well, he’d probably find out when making his way in the direction he
was supposed to follow. Still, he was wondering how he would escape the figures
that were destroying and rebuilding that forest. He would think about that later
on.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  He had to leave the warm stones, the wonderful, magic clearing, and he had to do so with
sorrow. He didn’t really know where he was going, at least not consciously. But he
had to find Simetra again; and the fairy, of course. As soon as he’d crossed the
border to the forest, another wonder seemed to take place: The clearing <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">followed </span>him.
This could probably mean that he was supposed to follow the fairy, but at least, it
meant that he was treading the correct path in a clear and cloudless, cold and starry
night.
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
  <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">7</span>  <a 
 id="x1-80007"></a>Coming to a First Conclusion</h2>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Since two hours, rain had been falling down.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >  He was all wet, and the grass he was walking on didn’t make things better at all. He had
realized that the rain only affected the clearing, for the dead forest around it would stay dry;
but still, he could not leave the clearing. Not that he longed to do so, but it was kind of
peculiar that you moved and the grass followed you. Though the spot where his feet touched
the ground was now quite muddy, for it followed him, too, he knew he was moving for the
trees of the dead forest in front of him vanished there to appear behind the clearing
again.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >  He had steadily followed the arrow he’d found on the nut, but now, he was getting tired.
Turning around and coming to a halt, he saw the stones that would invite him to take a rest;
And though there was the image of Simetra in his mind, and though he knew he had to go on,
he couldn’t resist. No sleep had come over him for long hours, but this time, as soon as his
head touched the stones, he fell asleep, ignoring the rain and the roaring thunder around
him…
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >  With the cruelty of a smashing hammer, a loud, crashing sound awoke him. He jumped, and
turned to see where the sound had come from; For a second, he thought that the ‘roadbuilder’
was close and that he could not escape him anymore; Then, he noticed a wooden sign that
seemed to <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">grow </span>just in front of him. He checked the nut with the arrow; Yes, this sign had
grown in the direction he had been advancing towards, and quite easily, he could even make
out the muddy spot again.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Letters began to form themselves on the still growing sign, and he was eager to find out
what he would be told, but for now, he could only stay here and wait. He sat down on the
small rocks again, and realized once more how smooth and soft they were, as if not stones, but
perfect pillows; Then, he heard the sound of a tiny fountain, and he turned around to
see the spring again. His thirst became apparent to him now, and he drank with
satisfaction.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  If he wasn’t missing Simetra and the fairy, and if he didn’t have a mission, he would have
loved this place; but thus, he could only admire it. An admiration full of sadness and
sorrow.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  But there was nothing he could do except sitting, drinking and waiting, hoping that this
sign would sort things out. The letters began to become visible, and he stood up to take a
closer look at them. Most peculiarly, he could read them without any problems; but, giving it
a second thought, why wouldn’t a magic sign know how to address him in his own
language?
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  Slowly, he began to decipher the first words, and things got easier the further he got; the
sign was still growing, and a lot of text was waiting for him:

<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >Puzzled was the wrong word to describe the way his thought were racing through his young
mind, crashing into each other to combine to an unknown mess. What did it mean? Was his
sister talking to him?
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >  He would have to figure this out later; he could take the sign with him. But — <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">WHERE?</span>
What did these magic words mean? He’d rarely seen such a difficult tongue before, and even
the most complicated books he’d read were easy in comparison with this here. As fast as he
could, he scanned the lines once more, hoping for an answer to come to his mind; Then, he
realized that he should not search for an answer, but wait for it. He should not move, but he
should not stay, either.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >  What had he done the last hours? He had moved — and stayed. But how could he do
the opposite? He had to <span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">be </span>moved. What could move him? <span 
class="ec-lmbx-10x-x-109">Who </span>could move him?
There was nobody here, and nothing inanimate could move on its own, unless…It was
magic! That was the solution. But how could he make this magic of his come alive, if
he didn’t even know that he had any? And how could he know that this sign was
real?
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >  He had a closer look at it; Magic had made it grow, and growth was a movement. But it had
stayed here…Suddenly, a burst of laughter reached his ears from far, far away. From the place
where he had been coming from. And a loud, smashing, steady sound was coming closer. He
had to get out, the sign was right. But how?
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >  A shudder ran down his spine, and he was sweating more than ever. This was wrong: He was
pushing for an answer again, as he was being forced to decide. He had to resist this urge to
decide…If the sign had been made grow by the magic of his sister, then this was part of him;
part of his magic. He took the sign and turned it around in his hands. Then, he
closed his eyes, trying to become less nervous. When he opened them again, he was
far from being calm, but he knew what he had to do. His magic would make him
move.
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >  The smashing sound must now be so close that it was only 100 metres away, but he
felt no fear anymore. This decision was final. The first and last conclusion that
would decide whether he was allowed to live on. He held the sign over the muddy
spot, still waiting for a second. Was he right? He had to be right, and if he wasn’t,
it was too late; He was not to search an answer, and this one seemed senseless;
                                                                                
                                                                                
He could never have searched for it. It must have come to him, as the sign had
predicted.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >  He planted the sign in the muddy spot and sat down on it. He sat down on the sign.
Nothing happened; what was wrong? The smashing sound was coming closer…
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >  Yes! He would not only need his, but their magic, too! Where could he get their magic in a
second? He could not open his bag that quickly, and he would risk to destroy the nuts. He
searched for an answer again; As soon as he realized this, another burst of laughter
was to be heard, <span 
class="ec-lmbx-10x-x-109">VERY </span>close this time. Closing his eyes and concentrating, he
suddenly heard something else: The spring! Quickly, he ran to it, took some water
in his hands and watered the post, then finally sitting down on it again. Before
he even touched it, a mass of ‘roadbuilders’ approached the clearing, this was the
sound he’d heard! They would smash him in a second…And a big, dangerous, black
figure seemed to hover among them, and it laughed again, grinning with an evil
face…

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Simetra was high in the sky, searching for her friend. As soon as he had been smashed to the
ground close to the clearing, she had carefully approached the fairy, who was this time
hovering above the spring, for she knew that something magic was approaching her. What she
didn’t know was the fact that the magic creature was using her own magic, to a little extent.
As she saw the bird and realized that she could speak, the fairy sat down again to
listen.
     <blockquote class="quote">
     <!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Help, help! You must help! Don’t fly away, stay and help! He’ll die!</blockquote>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The bird was nervously fluttering up and down; the fairy could see her own magic in the eyes of
her, and she knew the bird was true. Pity was filling her mind, and she rose again to follow the
small creature; a sphere of magic was accompanying her, and as soon as she got close
enough to Simetra, she was also enclosed by this green sphere of light. A peculiar, but
somehow…<span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">GOOD </span>warmth was flooding her. And suddenly, if she ever had had any doubts, she
knew she had done the right thing, for the fairy followed her. Only seconds later, the two
creatures flooded by magic reached the place of the accident; The fairy shot down
again, and as soon as her feet touched the ground, it became green; as green as the
grass of the clearing. Astonished about this strange reality and her own action that
followed, Simetra sat down on her shoulder, feeling as if she belonged there. Of
course, she was now containing part of her magic, but she could not understand how
she could have trusted her so fast without even realizing she was. As if done by
magic…
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  The same energy that had made her speak seemed to be flowing through her friend now,
and within a second, he was hovering in the air, his wounds closing and his skin emanating a
strange, bright, green light. He was now in a magic sphere of his own…Then, shortly before he
seemed to be normal again, this light around him changed; His sphere exploded in a dark blue
with a bit of red, looking like an ultraviolet ball of energy, but the fairy had already
turned around, as if her job was finished. Simetra, however, was still watching her
friend.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  The powerful, energetic sphere of him was growing now, contracting once more, and then…It
exploded in a shimmering burst of light! Simetra was blinded, but the fairy didn’t react in any
way. The ultraviolet sphere began to manifest itself again, but it was much bigger now,
somehow — touching the sphere of the fairy, mixing with it in a magic way the powerful bird
could not understand. Such things were not to be understood by a purely logic brain, and
Simetra was still learning how to use her newly gained emotions that added to her former
instincts. She had become human, in a way, but she was still like an animal, though she was
changing continuously.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  The green and the ultraviolet sphere were still in touch and Simetra was in the very middle
of it until the fairy moved away; still, she seemed not to have noticed anything. It was a sorry
sight if one knew what was going on, but nobody did. As soon as the fairy had flown far
enough to separate the two spheres, the ultraviolet one shrinked once more until it was
nothing more than the size of a tiny nut, hovering in front of him. Then, with a big ‘bang’, it
                                                                                
                                                                                
exploded again; but this time, the majestic power didn’t stop after it had reached the fairy.
The shockwave pushed against the green sphere, and the suddenly astonished fairy shrieked
highly as she was thrown above the trees, followed by Simetra who couldn’t react,
either.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >  Even if he had been awake, even if his closed eyes had been opened, he would not have been
able to understand what he had done. His instincts had controlled him and only his
emotions could realize what was going on. If he had been in control of his senses in that
moment, an eternal sorrow would have grabbed his soul and the feeling of loss and
bidirectional denial without having ever tried to establish a connection with all the
power one of them could have used. Ignorance, this was the word to express his
feelings.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  But he wasn’t awake, and the fairy wouldn’t remember anything except a sudden idea of
friendship with him. Then, a kind of magic yet unknown to him made him hover towards
the clearing, and he dropped on the stones in the middle of it, where he should
awake shortly after. Simetra, at the same time, was with the fairy in the light green
sphere, caught in their own magic. The brightness of the sphere was becoming less
apparent, and then, a minute after they had been shot right into the sky, it had
gone.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  Still, the two of them were accelerating. The fairy realized they had to stop, and do
so quickly. Thus, she spread her wings and grabbed the helpless bird, trying to
stop this unwanted Ascension. they had already been so high that their two pairs
of wings became frozen, and moments later, they began to fall like a stone. The
fairy aimed at the ground and formed a miracle with her hands, moving them in
a way that was so strange that Simetra’s eyes could not follow these movements.
Then, a green ball of light was flying even faster than the two of them, crushing
through the treetops and hitting the ground. At first, nothing seemed to happen,
but then, the trees shrinked away and a smooth patch of green was waiting for
them.

<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  He was now sitting on the sign, but still, nothing would happen. At least, not the thing he’d
hoped for, as he wasn’t moved by any kind of magic he could see. The black figure had now
stopped, realizing he was trying to escape, and even the ‘roadbuilders’ had stopped their
movements. His thoughts were racing until he realized once more that he should not
search for an answer. Then, the answer came. And the black figure was coming,
too.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  It was not hovering in the air anymore, but was standing on the ground, slowly approaching
him. When it saw his fingers trying to grab some bits of grass, it could not help but laugh
again. This creature was so helpless, it could never have been the cause of that magic wave
that had been rushing over this land hours before! The creature grinned. In fact, it grinned
until the grass had touched the sign. Then, it stopped and watched the spot where that —
<span 
class="ec-lmri-10x-x-109">MAN </span>— had been sitting just a second before. He was gone. and so was the sign, followed by
the muddy spot, the grass and the water. A majestic roar was to be heard, and the
‘roadbuilders’ destryoed the clearing in a second. He had escaped on a plant of running
words.
